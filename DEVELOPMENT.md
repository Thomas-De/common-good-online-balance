# Software Development

The web applications uses:
* Django 1.5 as a framework
* PostgreSQL as database
* Grunt for SASS to CSS compilation, livereloading (with browser_sync) and creating the HTML for the matrix overview page (dusthtml task).


# Development Cycle

* Run the Django server
* Run ``grunt`` - for CSS compilation
* If you want to change the Balance pages, read the section below.

## Balance pages

### Balance Overview page

The HTML for the 'company balance overview' page is generated by running the command ``grunt renderdust`` from the project directory.
It uses [Dust.js](https://github.com/sinnwerkstatt/sinnwerkstatt-web/blob/master/Javascript/Dustjs.md) to server-side render the ``company_balance_overview_LANG.html`` files 
with the data from the ``gwoe-matrix-data_LANG.js`` into the ``company_balance_overview-output_LANG.html`` files 
in the folder ``ecg_balancing/templates/ecg_balancing/dustjs``.

### Indicator page

The (sub)indicators data comes from the Javascript files in the ``static/js/data/indicators/LANG/`` folder. Please make all changes there.
